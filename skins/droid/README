Roundcube Plus Skins
====================

Roundcube Plus skins add a new look and enable mobile functionality in the Roundcube program.

Roundcube compatibility
-----------------------
The skins are compatible with Roundcube 1.2.x. They will not work properly with earlier versions or unreleased
beta versions of Roundcube.

Browser compatibility
---------------------
The skins are compatible with all modern browsers. Composing messages in html format is disabled in mobile skins due
to the incompatibility of the Roundcube html editor with mobile devices.

Plugin compatibility
--------------------
The skins do not support MyRoundcube plugins. MyRoundcube plugins have been discontinued and don't work properly with
the latest versions of Roundcube. They should no longer be used in a production environment. If you need replacement
plugins, visit http://roundcubeplus.com.

Upgrading legacy skins
----------------------
If you're upgrading a legacy version of the skins (1.x - 4.x) to version 5.x, follow these steps:

1. Delete the following skins from the skins directory: alpha, icloud, litecube, outlook, w21.
2. Delete the plugin "rcs_skins" from the plugins directory.
3. Remove the plugin "rcs_skins" from the plugin list in config/config.inc.php.
4. Follow the installation steps in the next section.

If you try to simply overwrite the older skin directories with version 5.x you may get unexpected results.

Installation steps
------------------
1. Copy the directories 'skins' and 'plugins' to the directory where your Roundcube is installed.

2. Edit the file 'config/config.inc.php', find the line that begins with $config['plugins'] and add 'xskin' to the
array, like this:

$config['plugins'] = array('xskin');

If the $config['plugins'] line doesn't exist in your config file, add it at the end of the file.

3. If you'd like to use Droid on the Roundcube login screen and as the default skin for the newly
created user accounts, edit 'config/config.inc.php', find the setting $config['skin'] and set it to 'droid'.
If this setting doesn't exist, add it at the end of the file, like this:

$config['skin'] = 'droid';

4. If you'd like to use your own branding images or customize other skin settings, copy the file
plugins/xskin/config.inc.php.dist to config.inc.php and follow the instructions given in that file.
